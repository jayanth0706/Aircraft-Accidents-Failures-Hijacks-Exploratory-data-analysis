# Aircraft Accidents, Failures & Hijacks – Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding trends, causes, and key insights from global aircraft incidents, including accidents, mechanical failures, and hijackings. The analysis is done using a historical dataset of aviation incidents.

## 📊 Project Overview

The project aims to answer questions such as:
- Which years had the most incidents?
- What are the most common causes of aircraft accidents?
- Are there specific operators, aircraft types, or locations with higher incident rates?
- How does survival rate vary across different types of incidents?

The insights derived from this analysis could benefit aviation safety experts, regulators, and enthusiasts interested in air travel safety patterns.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `AircraftAccidents,Failures&Hijacks.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA workflow.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Parsing dates, handling missing values, and standardizing categories.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Number of incidents per year and decade.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Analysis by country and region.
- **Operator & Aircraft Type Trends**: Identifying high-risk airlines and models.
- **Casualties & Survival**: Analyzing total fatalities and survival rates.
- **Cause & Summary Analysis**: Text mining to identify recurring themes and keywords in incident summaries.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
- WordCloud
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Yearly trend of aircraft incidents
- Fatal vs non-fatal accidents
- Word cloud of common incident summaries
- Geographic distribution of crashes

## 📌 Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from publicly available records of aircraft accidents and hijackings. It includes details such as:
- Date of incident
- Aircraft type and operator
- Location
- Number of fatalities
- Summary description

> Note: Ensure data privacy and sensitivity when using real-world datasets.
